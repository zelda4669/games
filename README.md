# Minigames

This site features Javascript-based minigames. This version took my console-based rock, paper, scissors game and added a user interface.

## Version Overview

Using vanilla JS, the user can play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The site dynamically keeps score so the user can see how they are doing vs the computer, and also keeps track of how many rounds have been played this session.

## New Concepts

This version makes use of event handlers to keep the HTML up-to-date.

## Next Steps:

- Game logic does not adhere to DRY principles -- it needs to be refactored to be more elegant
- CSS needs to be applied to make a more interesting site
